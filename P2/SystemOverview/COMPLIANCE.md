## 🔒 Competition Compliance Statement

> **"No document ingestion, RAG, or embeddings/vector DB used. Connector-first in-context synthesis only."**

This project strictly adheres to the "Connector-First" architecture:
1.  **No Vector DB**: We do not use Pinecone, Weaviate, or any vector stores.
2.  **No Embeddings**: We do not generate or store vector embeddings of documents.
3.  **Real-Time Context**: All AI answers are generated by injecting live data (from Blockchain, CSV, and Email Connectors) directly into the LLM context window at runtime.
